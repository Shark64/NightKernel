NightDOS Resource Kit

NightDOS uses linear memory addresses, and operates in protected
mode on the Intel x86 architecture.  

Hardware Layer 
---------------
This is the core of the computer, your basic mouse, keyboard, hard
drives, and such. Without an operating system, these parts can do
nothing for you. Since NightDOS implements a multi-tasking kernel, it
must isolate applications from the hardware and virtualize the
hardware to prevent system crashes. This virtualization allows for
multiple requests to be made to the hardware, which is then
prioritized and serialized by the next layer in NightDOS...  

The I/O Supervisor 
-------------------
This controls all input and output of the operating
system. This is a highly critical portion of code that prioritizes
and fields requests from different processes for hardware device
input/output.  

Kernel 
-------------------
NightDOS's kernel consists of 3 components. The kernel portion's
primary job is to schedule processes for running, this kernel has
been tweaked and optimized to run very fast using hand-tuned assembly
code to optimize code and data usage.  

The File System portion of the kernel handles all block device
requests (whether local or remote) using a unified set of procedures
and data structures.  This allows seamless integration of multiple
file systems through an installable file system manager. All
instances of file activity are invisible to the caller as this
portion of the kernel routes information to the correct device.

The final portion of the kernel is the memory manager. As the most
important part of NightDOS's core components, the memory manager
allocates memory on a demand basis. It also performs proper cleanup
after programs terminates and works behind the scenes to achieve
maximum performance under loaded conditions. It does this by
implementing a swap file.  This file contains pages of memory that
are not being used. This swap file exists on the hard drive and can
be on its own partition to save space. This file grows and shrinks
with the needs of the system and is removed when the system is
shutdown. 

NightDOS's memory manager also utilizes the V86 mode common on 386 and
later processors to provide a 16-bit virtualized DOS mode for classic
applications to run. In addition, NightDOS is also able to run certain
32-bit Windows console applications, in addition to its own catalog
of 32-bit applications.  As a drop in replacement for the standard
FreeDOS kernel, the typical user will retain their compatibility with
the DOS applications they are used to running, and gain the 32-bit
protected mode abilities, task switching between applications, and
increased overall performance in a DOS environment.
