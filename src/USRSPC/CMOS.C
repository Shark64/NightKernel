	This routine can be very dangerous if used improperly. There
	is usually no reason for an application program to directly
	modify the CMOS contents as the SETUP program maintains a
	sanity check through CRC to verify contents. Changing values
	with these routines without writing the CRC can produce
	damaging results.
