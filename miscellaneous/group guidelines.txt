Group guidelines

A. Use an appropriate title for a new topic thread. This not only helps keep the group organized, but also increases the likelihood of someone addressing the topic.

B. Do not demean or otherwise abuse users in any way or use generally inappropriate behavior, whether or not it is directed at any specific user.

C. This group has a general audience - do not post any form of offensive material. Refrain from using strong language - both in this group and in life. :)

D. Be mindful of copyright law. Do post, provide links to or ask for pirated material, or material to which you do not have ownership or permission to duplicate.

E. Spam or advertisements of any kind are not permitted. In cases of promoting other affiliations a user may have, certain exceptions may be made depending on the context of the conversation.

F. The group leadership is permitted to edit or delete any post.

G. The group leadership reserves the right to deny any join request as they see fit.

H. The views, opinions and statements made by other users in this group are not necessarily those of its leadership.

Violation of any one of these rules will result in the offending party being issued a warning. Three warnings will result in being banned from the group. Another request can be made to rejoin the group after six months for a user's first ban, or one year for their second ban. If banned a third time, the user is not permitted to rejoin the group.
