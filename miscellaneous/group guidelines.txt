1. Use an appropriate title for a new topic thread. This not only helps keep the group organized, but also increases the likelihood of someone addressing the topic.

2. Do not demean or otherwise abuse users in any way or use generally inappropriate behavior, whether or not it is directed at any specific user.

3. Do not post any form of offensive material. Refrain from using strong language - both in this group and in life. :)

4. Do post, provide links to or ask for pirated material, or material to which you do not have ownership or permission to duplicate.

5. Spam or advertisements of any kind are not permitted. In cases of promoting other affiliations a user may have, certain exceptions may be made depending on the context of the conversation.

6. Group leadership reserves the right to deny any join request.

7. Group leadership reserves the right to edit or delete any post.

8. The views, opinions and statements made by various users in this group are not necessarily those of its leadership.

9. Off-topic conversations are allowed, but try to restrict them to their own thread, lest existing topics become cluttered.

This list is not inclusive, and more guidelines may be added at any time as the group progresses.

Violation of any of these rules will result in a warning being issued. Three warnings will result in a ban from the group. Once banned, request may be made to rejoin the group after six months for the first ban, or one year for the second ban. If banned a third time, rejoining the group will not be permitted.
