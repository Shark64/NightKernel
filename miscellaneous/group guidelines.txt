This list is not inclusive, and more guidelines may be added at any time as the group progresses.

Violation of any one of these rules will result in the offending party being issued a warning. Three warnings will result in being banned from the group. The banned party may request to rejoin the group after six months for the first ban, or one year for their second ban. If banned a third time, rejoining the group will not be permitted.
