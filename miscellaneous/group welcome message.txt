Greetings, one and all! Welcome to the grand opening of the Night DOS Kernel group. :)

The Night kernel is a 32-bit drop-in replacement for the original 16-bit kernel of the FreeDOS operating system. It uses linear memory addressing and operates in protected mode on the Intel x86 architecture. The typical user will retain compatibility with their DOS applications and gain protected mode abilities such as task switching between applications, protected memory and increased overall performance in a DOS environment.

To achieve this goal, our first step was to discuss the amount (and difficulty) of work on a such a product. After careful consideration, the overall consensus is that, while some aspects may be challenging to implement, the benefits of a 32-bit DOS kernel far outweigh the cost in time, effort and planning.

The project is go! Which is where this group comes in.

The Night DOS Kernel group will be used for discussing design and implementation, as well as making documentation and tech notes along the way. Any and all aspects of the kernel are up for discussion; most things are not yet set in stone.

The kernel team is currently fairly small but new members are always welcome. If you have useful experience and/or ideas which can advance the project, feel free to request to join us!

For the summary of the ideas, bugs, problems and solutions, see the Night Kernel Tech Reference on GitHub: github.com/mercury0x000d/NightDOSKernel

Email any complaints to Maarten at netraam70@gmail.com and we will do our best to find a solution.

This project was launched on June 24, 2015 by mercury0x000d.

Thank you for your interest and help!

The Night DOS Kernel team,
