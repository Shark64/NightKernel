6/4/2018, 0.10 Update - Stupid little fixes
- Changed major and minor version numbers to byte size in globals.asm
- Fixed a bug in the newly optimized PCI device name table where the date being written to screen wasn't coming from the right place. And also saved around 300 bytes!



6/4/2018, 0.10 Update - List Manager, 50-line text mode support
- Added 50-line text mode support. Nice for viewing those beautiful diagnostic messages at boot!
- Added allocation for 8 KiB main stack (size set by global value)
- Added configbits setting for screen lines at startup
- Added CRC32() to misc.asm for data checksumming
- Added mouseXLimit and mouseYLimit to the system struct (replaces old method of using the current VESA screen resolution)
- Added PCIDriverLoad() and PCIDriverSearch() for the upcoming driver addition
- Added the beginning of Night's first driver, IDE Controller.asm!
- Added the List Manager (api/lists.asm) to manage lists of things; something the kernel will often need to do
- Changed Debug menu PCI device list to now use List Manager to build its list live and cut the wasted space from hard-coding
- Changed IDT memory to be allocated instead of using a static address
- Changed MemoryInit() to respect the BIOS memory map and no longer allocate at an arbitrary address
- Cleaned up interrupt code and merged 3 files (setints.asm, inthandle.asm, idt.asm) into a single file: interrupts.asm
- Incorporated disks.asm into IDE driver
- Made boot-time diagnostic messages and debug menu obey configbits settings
- Made new folder (api) for accessory code to be used by the kernel and be made available via the Night API
- Minor change to structure of all function descriptions
- Moved ConvertToHexString16() from screen.asm to strings.asm
- Moved keyboard-related globals to ps2.asm
- Moved strings.asm from system folder to api folder
- Moved temporary stack (the only stack we've been using up to this point!) from 0x9F800 to 0x600
- Optimized MemCopy to transfer 16 bytes at a time instead of just one
- Optimized text scrolling algorithm to copy in 16-byte chunks, giving a 76.5% speed increase
- Removed kCRLF from the globals, as it's no longer used
- Removed VESA structs from the globals since we don't have VESA support anymore :/
- Renamed system/api.asm to api/misc.asm
- Trimmed unused routines (PrintDebug, PrintSimple, SetSystemVESA) from misc.asm



4/25/2018, 0.0F Update - Final PCI system
- Added version information to kernel info screen
- Changed PCI system to load device data into RAM and source all subsequent register reads from there
- Made minor changes to folder structure
- Other minor changes



1/19/2018, 0.0E Update - Now runs on real hardware!
- Added automatic sequential highlighted printing to PrintRegsVESA() (formerly RegDump) for extra ease of use
- Added PCI bus probing to kernel startup so it only needs done once because it takes so long
- Added PCI device info dump to debug menu
- Added PCIGetDeviceCount to return the total number of PCI devices (functions) in the system
- Added text color and location features Print16 and Print32 complete with autoscrolling text as the bottom of the screen is reached
- Added HomeCursor()
- Added handlers for breakpoint, invalid opcode and GPF exceptions
- Removed VESA support in favor of later having a dedicated graphics driver handle video
- Changed PrintRegs() (formerly RegDump) to not use StringBuild() to do its job, since I needed PrintRegs() to debug StringBuild() O.O
- Changed initial boot code in kernel.asm to print small diagnostic messages to assist debugging on real hardware
- Changed the preferred method of clearing strings from MemCopy-ing an already cleared string over the working one to simply using MemFill to fill the string space with zeros to eliminate the wasted space of the blank strings
- Changed the token used in StringBuild() to ^ instead of %. Why? Mac throwback! 8-)
- Changed text printing routines to work identically in both 16 and 32 bit mode
- Changed the formatting of the GPL text in the beginning of every. Single. File.
- Fixed a read after end of string bug in BuildString() which gave weird results with tokens
- Moved some data out of globals.asm and into the respective files with related routines and removed some unused data to tidy up the globals



12/6/2017, 0.0D Update - Milestone 1
- Added beginning of framework for PCI support (Exelyx C code which will be rewritten in assembly)
- Moved some code around
- Polished LBA code
- Slight modifications to the Debug code
- Structured the project into directories
- Tested and polished the dummy memory allocation routine



12/2/2017, 0.0C Update
- Changed screen.asm to vesa.asm
- Added ConvertToOctalString() and ConvertToBinaryString() to api.asm
- Added ticksSinceBoot system variable for easier timing of events over spans of more than one second
- Added strings.asm
- Added MemFill() and MemCopy() to memory.asm
- Added VESALoadIcon() to vesa.asm
- Added RegDump() to debug.asm for more debugging ease



11/8/2017, 0.0B Update
- Modified Random() to return numbers within a requested limit
- Added a starfield to the boot screen (Makes a nice test for Random()'s new feature! :) )
- Made boot screen selectable by ConfigBits (Also made it disabled by default for now. See the notes at the bottom of globals.asm for details on what ConfigBits can control.)
- Identified (and thus far did nothing about) a bug where the kernel throws an Invalid Opcode exception at 0008:0000001F when started with insufficient video RAM
- Cleaned up kernel.asm and moved some IDT setup code that used to be there to idt.asm
- Added a crosshair cursor (and a couple other surprises) to the Mouse Tracking Test
- Modified VESAPlot() to clip pixels outside the LFB (Writing to memory outside your target is a Very Bad Thing)
- Added the beginning of a RAM browser to the debug menu for inspecting memory without relying on the VirtualBox debugger
- Added ConvertDecimalToString()



11/3/2017, 0.0A Update
-Fixed bug in VESAInit() where setting VESA mode fails silently if video hardware does not support VESA (The error message for the VESA init failing was being printed using VESA. Yes, that is as bad as it sounds. :) )
-Fixed bug in VESAPlot32() where 16-bit registers were being used instead of 32-bit causing graphical errors when drawing at certain points on the screen
-Fixed error message printing in A20Enable()
-Changed infinite loops (except the main one!) to a simple "jmp $"
-Added beginning of serial communication routines (Existing routines transmit data, but still need to add interrupt handlers that actually do something useful. Also only really works on port 1 for now.)
-Added pushad/popad to all unused interrupt handlers for future sanity
-Added VESAClearScreen()
-Added boot logo
-Added TimerWait()
-Added the beginnings of a debug menu (debug.asm)
-Beautification of teh codez1! (Tabs > spaces, kids.)

10/21/2017, 0.08 Cleanup
-split some code from hardware.asm into pic.asm, ps2.asm and screen.asm
-split some code from kernel.asm into api.asm and hardware.asm
-updated all copyright dates and copyright message
-merged build.sh and debug.sh into one script
-modified buildrun.sh to mount the floppy image on its own instead of relying on VirtualBox to already be configured with a specific image to allow more flexibility
...and EVERYTHING STILL WORKS! :D



8/31/2016, 0.08 Update
-Fixed a horribly insidious bug in which the correct VESAPrint function pointer is not used if the address of the low byte of the VESAPrint32 function address happens to be 0x18
-Added limiters on mouse position counters
-Added a DebugPrint as a quick debug aid
-Added jmp $ instructions to all exception handlers which are unimplemented as of yet to make it apparent if the system happens to fall into one. You can't miss a blantant hang lol
