Any structures used in real mode prior to mode switch to protected are invalid once kernel enters protected mode.
This map is representative of the post-mode switch ONLY.

0x00000000 - 0x000005FF			empty
0x00000600 - 0x000105FF			kernel (loaded at 0x600 by FreeDOS bootloader, not to exceed 64K)
0x00010600 - 0x000FFFFF			unspecified
0x00100000 - 0xFFFFFFFF			application use (should be probed to determine size upon boot)

More to come!
